Round 1 Interview

At first, I am very nervous coz, I am a little introverted in nature and in the past, I declined cybsec interview for joining into the club due to introvert-ness.
But the first question in the interview is, tell me about yourself with mentioning grades(more stress on grades)
Then in my mind, I thought, they are considering grades are the priority and there is much less probability of me selecting in the interview.
At that point itself I lost all the stress I am feeling till that point and tried to answer the questions with as much confident as I can.
Also saying "NO" or "I DONT KNOW" to the questions that I don't know the answers to. (This gave for my interviewers to ask little more depth questions on topics I learned).

Final Comment

As of my experience, Try to explain the answer with real-world examples as much as possible. Try to be as much confident and honest as possible. This is just my experience, if you find this irrelevant or less content work - can completely ignore it.
