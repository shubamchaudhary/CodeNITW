ONLINE TEST

##### About Online Test

It consists of 4 sections:Coding,Aptitude,CS Fundamentals and 2 HR Questions.
Coding questions are based on Breadth First search, Dynamic Programming and arrays mostly. These are doable if you had enough practice in DSA and coding platforms like Leetcode.
Aptitude was mostly on probability,permutations and combinations and logical reasoning.
CS Fundamentals - These are OOP based
HR Questions - These are like how do you behave in the given situation

Round 1 Interview

This round started with an introduction and discussion on the projects mentioned in resume. Later, I was asked a simple probability question(w white balls and b black balls probability that last ball is white).Then , I was asked to explain logic for coding question(Min no of steps to reach target position in snake and ladders game). I tried to give a pseudo code for that as well.
Later,I was asked to find no.of ways to reach in min no.of steps. As I was able to answer above questions, he asked me if I could give probability that we will reach in minimum no.of steps. I wasn't able to answer it correctly but gave a try. Finally, it ended by asking if I have any questions for interviewer.

Round 2 Interview

This round also started with Projects discussion.Later, I was asked what other subjects did I learn other than those mentioned in resume.
Then, we moved to DSA part. I was asked full binary tree definition  and no of missing nodes in a full binary tree.  I was asked some simple probability questions.Probability that two tosses will be heads if 2 coins are given . Probability that you get sum as 7 if two dices are rolled, some questions on expectations ,find indices i and j such that a\[i\]-a\[j\] is maximum,and then he added a constraint that i>j and asked to solve.

This round was more like to evaluate if you are good at basics in DSA and probability

Round 3 Interview

This round was like a normal conversation. The interviewer asked how were my first 2 rounds .At last, he asked feedback of interview process, and it was ended by asking if I have any questions for him.

Final Comment

Do concentrate on basics of DSA and probability as well. Try to interact with the interviewer throughtout the interview. Don't stay quiet instead try to explain where you are struck . Be prepared to ask few questions to the interviewer at the end.
Try to be as calm as possible during the interview process.

Verdict: Selected
