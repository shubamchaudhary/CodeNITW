##### About Online Test

The OT was pretty easy and straightforward. There were 2 coding questions. The level of questions was around leetcode easy to medium. Just some basic questions. I was able to solve them in less than 20 minutes.

Round 1 Interview

Interview 1/3 Technical Round
Started with basic intro and stuff. First he asked to reverse a string. He then asked to check if the string is palindrome. One more question of string was asked.
Then he asked me to tell any 2 sorts. A technical issue popped up in Zoom while I was answering the question, so the interview was cut short. Interview was supposed to be 35-40 minutes, ended up being about 20 minutes.

Round 2 Interview

Interview 2/3 Technical Round
Started with a question whose answer I didnâ€™t know initially. Tried answering the question somehow based on logic and common sense. The interviewer helped me a little to reach the answer.
He then asked me to tell any 2 sorts. I answered merge sort and BST sort. He asked me to explain what is BST sort. He also asked 2-3 basic questions about OOP.
There was a DBMS project in my resume. He asked 2-3 questions about the details of the project. He then asked, how to efficiently search a name in millions of records. Then he asked indexing.
In the end, I asked the solution of the first question. He said that he wonâ€™t consider that question for evaluation, because the topic(semaphore) wasnâ€™t taught in the class.

Round 3 Interview

Interview 3/3 Hiring Manager Round
Went straight to resume. Looked at the DBMS project and started asking questions about the project. She asked why did we use MySQL(she was expecting me to say relational database). One of the reasons I gave was that MySQL is open-source. She then asked what is open source, is linux open source, source code availability on the internet and so on. At this stage she started creating doubts in my mind by repeatedly asking whether I was sure or isnâ€™t this other thing correct and such similar stuff.
She then asked me whether I know what ServiceNow does. Ans: Itâ€™s a cloud based something somethingâ€¦.. She asked asked me questions about cloud computing. The questions werenâ€™t very complex as such, just the basic stuff.
The interviewer is from the QA testing team. She gave me a scenario, where we created a product that delivers medicine from pharmacies to homes. How would the testing be done?
tbh, I had no idea about testing. I used my logic and common sense to answer it as much as I could. Things like testing the components(functions) independently, testing the integration of components, testing the deployment.
Thatsâ€™s all I remember ðŸ˜…

Final Comment

ServiceNow doesnâ€™t ask fancy stuff. They just check if your foundations are clear and strong. The people are very friendly. So donâ€™t get nervous during the interviews. Just be loud and clear when speaking. Confidence is the thing that matters the most in the interview.
If you are confident and have strong CS foundations, chances of selection are pretty high.
All the best!
