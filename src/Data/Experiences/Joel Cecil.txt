Final Comment

The coding questions were easy… only required basic DSA and programming skills. Just be confident and always express your ideas and thoughts while you are coding in the interview.
Revise all the DSA, DBMS and OOP theory concepts.
Do a bit of research on the company (or just pay attention during the pre placement talk).
If you have worked on any tech project, make sure you understand the working of each and every component in it. 
If you haven't, you may be asked to solve puzzles or other aptitude questions, linux commands and shell scripting.
And most importantly, believe in yourself. All the best!
